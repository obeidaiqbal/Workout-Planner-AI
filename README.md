## Workout-Planner-AI Project

### Overview

- A full-stack application that generates a custom 3-month workout plan using user input. Built with **React** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend)

---

### Structure

`backend/`:
- **FastAPI** app with a `POST /submit` endpoint that accepts workout data
- Configured with **CORS middleware** to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`

`frontend/`:
- React application built with `create-react-app`
- Displays a form to collect user data (e.g., goals, experience, measurements)
- Sends the collected data as JSON to the FastAPI backend using `fetch`
- Uses a proxy to route API requests to the backend by setting this in `package.json`:
  ```json
  "proxy": "http://localhost:8000"
  ```
